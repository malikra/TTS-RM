# Task Tracking Tool

This repository will serve as an example for Madison College's Enterprise Java Class. 

### Problem Statement

It is hard to find Task Tracking tool, there are some available in market but not free of cost. The reason of developing Task Tracking system is to provide 
students a tool for free of cost which they can use to track how much time did they spend on each task daily or weekly or monthly bases which can help them to 
improve their performance. This tool allows student to add new or delete or update their task, they also can create a To Do List which reminds them future assigned tasks
which can help them identifying their checkpoints and deadline of each task.
